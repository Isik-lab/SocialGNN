The original videos and annotations can be requested from here: [Link](https://tshu.io/PHASE/)

Preprocessed annotations and bootstrapped train/test split IDs for the main set are given here as pickle files.

#### To Trim and Preprocess Again
  ```
  python trim_and_preprocess.py <main/genset>
  ```
Then create bootstrapped splits of train/test video IDs for analysis with the main set.
